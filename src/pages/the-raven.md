Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary, over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.

Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly had I sought to borrow from my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost Lenore.
